            <button class="flex w-full text-left"><span class="flex-grow font-semibold">How does Dunder Mifflin paper differ from other products?</span><img class="w-12" src="placeholders/icons/angle-bottom.svg" alt=""></button>
            <p class="mt-1">Paper produced with love, devotion, passion - is not the same paper. Our supplies are extra strong, and you’re going to need the paper-tear up-master to destroy just one sheet. It’s also suited for every available printer.</p>

            <button class="flex w-full text-left"><span class="flex-grow font-semibold">Why choose Dunder Mifflin instead of some huge paper producer?</span><img class="w-12" src="placeholders/icons/angle-bottom.svg" alt=""></button>
            <p class="hidden mt-1">You know that feeling when you are waiting on the phone for hours to contact your supplier? Sometimes they even have a waiting time music prepared for that. In Dunder Mifflin, you can get help immediately, and each of our customers receives an individual assistant. For us, companies are people - not numbers, so we take care of each of them.</p>

            <p class="hidden mt-1">If you buy one of our business plans, you will receive the supplies every first Monday of the month. However, you can also purchase paper separately. Our employees will make sure that you will receive the products in the next business days.</p>

            <p class="hidden mt-1">The whole process depends on your decision. If you sign the contract immediately, we can start official cooperation in the next two business days.</p>
